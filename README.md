# 🧶 Crochet Round — Spot the SC

A fun, interactive crochet learning game!  
Players drag a crochet hook around a round of stitches and try to spot the **single crochet ("SC") stitches**.  
As soon as the hook touches a real stitch on mobile, or when a user clicks/taps one on desktop, it gets selected.  
Complete all rounds to finish the cat. 🐱✨
